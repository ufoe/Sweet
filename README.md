Disclaimer

Sweet right now is alpha software. It can delete your contacts or mix
them up. As of now, use in production servers is discouraged. You are
warned


Description
-----------

Sweet is an Android application that can sync your SugarCRM contacts
with your Android mobile phone. As of now, it will perform a two way
sync the following fields:

- First and last name
- Title and Account Name (company)
- Work phone, Mobile phone and Fax
- Primary email
- Primary postal address


Sweet features editing contacts offline in your phone and uploading
them to the SugarCRM at a later time works. In case of a conflict it
will present you with a UI showing the differences so you can resolve
them and save the changes in the server and the phone. Due to
limitations in stock the Android contact editor a custom interface is
provided to edit contacts. In order to show this interface one must
press the SugarCRM profile entry in the contact detailed view, using
the contact editor will not work.

Adding contacts in the phone is also supported and will be accordingly
uploaded to the server. As of now this is a little bit cumbersome: one
must first add a contact to this acccount. The stock android editor
will only allow you to put the first and last name. After doing this
you need to perform a sync which will add the needed profile entry to
the contact. You can the proceed as usual.
